# Python Modules

These are a series of projects designed to introduce the Python programming language and its interface. They are designed to be thematic implementations of specific more complex themes. 

## Module Breackkdown

 - **Module 00 (** *v 2.1* **):** Introduction to core Python concepts, including variables, functions, data input/output, control flow (`if`, `while`, `for`, `range`), basic recursion, helper functions, and type annotations.

 - **Module 01 (** *v 2.1* **):** Introduction to Python programming with a focus on object-oriented design. Covers class construction (constructors and methods), encapsulation and data protection, getters and setters, inheritance using `super()`, basic composition, and the use of decorators such as `@classmethod` and `@staticmethod`. Also introduces executable script structure with `if __name__ == "__main__":`.

  - **Module 02 (** *v 2.1* **):** Introduction to error handling in Python using `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks. Focus on raising and managing exceptions (`ValueError`, `ZeroDivisionError`, `FileNotFoundError`, `KeyError`) and designing custom exception classes with meaningful error messages. Emphasis on building resilient programs that handle failures gracefully while maintaining system stability.

  - **Module 03 (** *v 2.1* **):** Introduction to the `sys` module for handling command-line input (`sys.argv`). Applied core Python collections (`list`, `set`, `dict`) for data processing and analytics tasks. Implemented memory-efficient data streaming with `generators` and practiced advanced data transformation using `list`, `dict`, and `set comprehensions`.

  - **Module 04 (** *v 2.1* **):**
